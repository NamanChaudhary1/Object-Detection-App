# Object-Detection-App
Object Detection app made using Kotlin in Android Studio
# Object Identification with TensorFlow

This Kotlin project utilizes TensorFlow to identify objects in images. It leverages pre-trained models and the power of deep learning to accurately classify objects with high precision.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Kotlin SDK
- TensorFlow library
- Android Studio or any Kotlin-compatible IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:``
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-identification-tensorflow.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3.Install the required dependencies using Gradle.

## Usage
Launch the application on an Android device or emulator.

Capture an image.

The TensorFlow model will analyze the image and identify the objects present in it.

The identified objects will be displayed on the screen along with their corresponding confidence scores.

Explore the project code to understand how the TensorFlow model is integrated and utilized for object identification.

Customization
If you want to use a different TensorFlow model or train your own model for object identification, follow these steps:

Prepare your custom TensorFlow model by training it on a suitable dataset.

Replace the existing TensorFlow model file (model.tflite) in the project with your custom model.

Update the code to load and use your custom model for object identification. Make necessary changes in the model loading and inference code.

Rebuild and run the project to apply the changes.
